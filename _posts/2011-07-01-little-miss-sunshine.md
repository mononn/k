"인생은 저 망할 미인대회 같은 경쟁의 연속"이라는 드웨인의 말처럼, 누군가의 평가(사회적 평판)으로 형성된 타인의 삶(성공의 전형)을 부채로 안고 막연한 미래로 행복을 이전하는 우리는 불만족스러운 현실을 부정하며 얼마나 이 빛나는 (현재라는)순간들을 놓치고 있는 것일까?

> You know Marcel Proust? French writer. Total loser. Never had a real job. Umrequited love affairs. Gay. Spent twenty years writing a book almost no one reads. But he was also probably the greatest writer since Shakespeare. Anyway, he, uh … gets down to the end of his life, and he looks back and he decides that all those years he suffered-those were the best years of his life. Because they made him who he was. All the years he was happy, you know, total waste. Din’t learn a thing. So, if you sleep until you’re eighteen, ah … Think of the suffering you’re gonna miss.
